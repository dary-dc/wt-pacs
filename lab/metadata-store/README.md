# metadata-store

What a page open reads, from four stores of the parser's metadata groups
([`docs/ingest/metadata-draft.md`](../../docs/ingest/metadata-draft.md) §2): **A** the parser's group files, **B** each
group whole in SQLite plus a column per page value, **C** one SQLite row per attribute under DECK's ordered key, **D** a
sorted key file searched by binary search with the values apart. Every store is built from the same groups, every
read must hand back the same page values before it is timed, and C must give back each group byte for byte.

```bash
cargo run -p metadata-store --release -- --instances 4,200,2000 --rounds 200 > rows.jsonl
```

**The series.** One real instance group and its series group, from the parser's `doc/PACS/db/deck.db` at `f36230b`
(a public CT sample, 45 attributes), in [`fixtures/`](fixtures) with DECK's prefix taken off as the directory output
writes them. A series of N instances repeats that group with its own SOP instance UID, instance number and slice
position. **The page's read** is, per instance, the instance number, photometric interpretation, window centre and
width, and rescale intercept and slope (`client/viewer/viewer.js`); this sample has no window, so those two come back
empty.

**The reads.** *Scan* reads every row of the series and keeps the page's tags; *seek* reads only each instance's key
range from (0020,0013) to (0028,1053), then jumps to the next instance. *Opened* opens the store for each read, as a
server holding no study open would; *held* reuses one open handle. A always opens.

**What it does not say.** One thread on one host, every file in the page cache (written just before, never evicted):
no claim about a cold disk or about many sessions at once. D's fixed 16-byte keys hold top-level attributes only; a
group with a sequence makes the build refuse.

**`--mode pair`** times the recommended pair and its runner-up, each one SQLite file in WAL at `synchronous=FULL`: T1, the
truth as a row per received group, and T2, a row per attribute, each with V1, one page row per series holding the
page's document. Pre-registered and recorded in the draft's §2: the page open (held and opened, D's held scan as the
reference), one update (a new revision of one instance's rescale intercept, the page row rebuilt, one commit), the
rebuild alone, every received group's BLAKE3, a reader in a second process during updates (`--reader`, started by the
run), and size.

```bash
cargo run -p metadata-store --release -- --mode pair --instances 4,200,2000 --rounds 300 --updates 60 > pair.jsonl
```
