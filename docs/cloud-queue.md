# Cloud queue

A place to hand work to a cloud agent between sessions, and for it to hand results back.
`cloud-lanes-2026-09-14.md` holds the briefs; this holds the order and the state.

## Protocol

**You are the cloud agent.** After you finish a lane and push:

1. `git fetch && git rebase origin/claude/serene-rubin-wakfg7` — the queue changes while you work.
2. Read the table below. Take the **topmost row marked `ready`**.
3. Edit that row to `claimed` with the date, commit it alone, push it. That is the lock; if the
   push is rejected someone took it first, so rebase and take the next one.
4. Do the lane. Push your work.
5. Set the row to `done` with the commit, and **add anything you learned that changes another
   row** — a lane that is now pointless, a prerequisite that turned out missing. Push.
6. Go back to step 1. Stop when no row is `ready`, and say so in your final message rather than
   inventing work.

**Answering a question rather than running a lane.** A row may be a question, not a lane. Answer it
in `## Answers` below, push, mark it done. Keep it short — the asker has no other channel.

**Asking for something.** If a lane is blocked on a decision only the workstation can make, add a
row to `## Blocked` saying what you need, push, and move to the next `ready` row. Do not wait.

### L11 — decode in the harness

```
The harness does not decode: client/harness/index.html says "not clinical decode" and
shell.js touch() reads one byte per 4 KiB purely to make the copy real. That is why the
decode and pipeline questions have had no home here.

L8 built a decoder from source that is byte-identical to the package across 609 frames
and takes a 4 MB floor at 512x512. Use it. Wire a real decode path into the harness:
one pool, first-free dispatch (a free decoder takes the next frame; not round-robin),
sized from navigator.hardwareConcurrency rather than a constant.

Then measure the thing nobody has: first-free against round-robin, at equal width. It is
believed to matter when decode times are uneven and to be a wash when they are even. That
belief has never been tested in either direction. Uneven decode times are the device case,
so if it is a wash on uniform frames say so and then make them uneven — mixed sizes in one
pool — and measure again.

Report the per-frame split: time waiting for a decoder, time decoding, time for the page
to take it. They must sum to the total; a split that does not sum is not a split.

This is client-shape milestone M2 (docs/client-shape-plan.md). Structural: propose the
shape before implementing it.

## Answers

**`wasm-pack` cannot fetch `wasm-opt` in the cloud container** (2026-09-15, from L4). The build
compiles, then dies on `failed to download …/binaryen-version_117-x86_64-linux.tar.gz`. The URL is
reachable — `curl` gets 200 — so it is wasm-pack's own downloader not using the proxy, not an egress
block. Seeding its cache by hand works and costs a minute:

```bash
curl -sSL -o /tmp/b.tar.gz https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen/releases/download/version_117/binaryen-version_117-x86_64-linux.tar.gz
# the dirname is a hash of the URL; wasm-pack writes .<dirname>.lock before it downloads, so run
# build.sh once and read the name out of ~/.cache/.wasm-pack/
mkdir -p ~/.cache/.wasm-pack/wasm-opt-1ceaaea8b7b5f7e0
tar xzf /tmp/b.tar.gz -C ~/.cache/.wasm-pack/wasm-opt-1ceaaea8b7b5f7e0 --strip-components=1
```

It wants `<dirname>/bin/wasm-opt`. Any lane needing a WASM build per arm — **L2** — pays this first.
`rustwasm.github.io` is blocked by egress policy (403), so install wasm-pack with `cargo install
wasm-pack`, not the shell installer.

**A cancelled fill leaves its waiters armed until `FRAME_TIMEOUT_MS`** (from L4). `endStream()`
stops the server sending but settles nothing on the client, so the promises sit for 15 s. Not
fixed: it wants a decision about what a cancelled waiter should reject with. Relevant to **L11**,
which will cancel fills for real, and to L6's lifecycle work.
