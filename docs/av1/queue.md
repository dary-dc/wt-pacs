# AV1 queue

The AV1 phase's work, handed to cloud agents: order and state here, findings in the doc that owns
the subject ([`README.md`](README.md) for the phase's decisions, `decode/README.md`, `FIXTURES.md`,
`WIRE.md` for theirs). Separate from [`../cloud-queue.md`](../cloud-queue.md) on purpose: that queue
and its branch belong to other work.

## Protocol

**This queue lives on `claude/av1`. Push only to `claude/av1`** — never to
`claude/unified-2026-09-23`, `main` or any other branch, and never edit `docs/cloud-queue.md`.

1. `git fetch origin && git checkout claude/av1 && git rebase origin/claude/av1`.
2. Read `CLAUDE.md`, then [`README.md`](README.md) (this phase), then the table below.
3. Take the **topmost `ready` row**. Set it to `claimed` with the date, commit that alone, push. The
   push is the lock: if it is rejected, rebase and take the next `ready` row.
4. Do the lane. Push your work (rebase first).
5. Set the row to `done` with the commit hash after the rebase that pushed it, a one-line verdict
   with its numbers, and where the finding lives. Flip any `after …` row whose prerequisites are now
   all done to `ready` in the same commit. Push.
6. Back to 1. Stop when no row is `ready` and say so; do not invent work.

**Rules every row keeps.**

* **Bit-exact, always.** Ground truth is the encoder's input samples (a checksum written when the
  input is made), never the output of a decoder under test. A path that is not exact is reported,
  not used.
* **Mutate every new test or check** and watch it fail before trusting it.
* **Interleave arms** in any timing (`lab/order.mjs`, `lab/scripts/order.py`); give n and the
  spread; say where the host saturates and claim nothing past it. Containers are not phones: a
  decode time is a container's unless measured elsewhere, and says so.
* **Pin every tool** (tag or version, and a checksum of anything fetched). Fetched data and built
  binaries are not committed; the script that makes them is.
* **Code beside today's path, not instead of it.** HTJ2K keeps working unchanged; the gate
  (`scripts/gate.sh`) stays green. A change to the transport's unit, the wire or the store's format
  is structural: propose it in the owning doc, do not build it.
* **This repository is public.** Never name another viewer, its SDK, a vendor, or any private
  project. Licences go in [`licensing.md`](licensing.md); anything new that is shipped or fetched
  is added there with its licence before it is used.
* Commit messages hold the change only — no attribution, co-author or session trailers.
* Blocked on a decision only the owner can make: add it under `## Blocked`, push, take the next row.

## Briefs

### 1 TOOL

Build pinned **libaom** (`aomenc`), **SVT-AV1** (`SvtAv1EncApp`) and **dav1d** (CLI, `-Dbitdepths=8,16`)
from source, `lab/av1/tools.sh` (the way `lab/scripts/gen_htj2k_fixtures.sh` builds OpenJPH). For
each encoder, find the settings that code **mathematically lossless** (libaom `--lossless=1`; check
what SVT-AV1 offers — if it has no lossless mode, say so and drop it) and test a round trip
(encode → `dav1d` → compare against the input's checksum) on synthetic frames from
`lab/scripts/gen_frame_pnm.py`:

* grey 8 and 10 bit as 4:0:0 (`--monochrome`, Main profile) and 12 bit as 4:0:0 (Professional);
  RGB 8-bit as 4:4:4 with identity matrix (`matrix_coefficients` 0, GBR; High profile) — 4:2:0
  would drop colour and is not lossless;
* intra-only (every frame a keyframe) and inter (a group length of 8, say).

**Test two libaom versions**: an older 3.8.x and the newest release. Inter-coded 10- and 12-bit
grey is known to have come back inexact from 3.8.x ([`README.md`](README.md) §Prior evidence); the
verdict says, per version, which cells are exact, and pins the one the project uses. A cell inexact
on every version is not used, and says so. SVT-AV1 and rav1e are reported to have no usable
lossless mode: confirm or correct in one line each.

Record the exact command lines in `lab/av1/README.md` and which (encoder × depth × layout × mode)
cells are exact. A pipeline that writes Y4M or IVF: say which container the decoder is fed, and how a
frame's OBUs are split out (a temporal unit per frame), since the store holds one frame per entry.

### 2 DATA

The synthetic sets add independent noise to every frame, so they cannot answer whether inter coding
pays ([`README.md`](README.md) §A4). Find public multi-frame series under CC0 or CC BY (or a licence
as open — record it). Candidates, **each licence verified, not assumed**: TCIA collections through
the public NBIA `getImage` API (LIDC-IDRI CT, ISPY1 MR, CBIS-DDSM), the MONAI ultrasound working
group's anonymised clip, DICOM test-data repositories (a test-data directory inside a GPL project
may not be open for reuse). Wanted: a CT stack (12-bit signed), an MR stack, an ultrasound cine (8-bit colour), and
an X-ray angiography run if one is open. Prefer sources a container can reach without an account.
This is the one exception to `FIXTURES.md`'s generated-only rule, because the question is about real
content: say so there. Write `lab/av1/fetch_data.sh` that downloads them to a gitignored directory, checks a pinned
SHA-256, and extracts frames as raw samples plus their checksums (pydicom or similar, pinned). The
set, its source, licence, attribution and checksums go in `FIXTURES.md` §AV1 data (new). If nothing
reachable is open enough, say so under `## Blocked` with what you found.

### 3 WCAP

In headless Chromium (the version the lab already uses), run `VideoDecoder.isConfigSupported` over
AV1 profiles 0/1/2 × bit depth 8/10/12 × mono/4:2:0/4:4:4, hardware and software preference. For
every supported config, decode a lossless stream — one `EncodedVideoChunk` per temporal unit, `key`
only on keyframes, the sequence header in-band. An earlier probe got **no frames** from lossless
streams with the config reported supported ([`README.md`](README.md) §Prior evidence): find out
why (packaging, the decoder chosen, lossless itself) before concluding. Make the streams with any pinned encoder — ffmpeg's
libaom is fine for this row — and record the command), `copyTo` each `VideoFrame` and compare against
the encoder input's checksum. Record the `VideoFrame.format` returned, whether a mono stream comes
back with chroma planes, and any conversion. Verdict: the list of (profile, depth, layout) cells
WebCodecs returns exactly on this platform, and what that cannot say about phones or Safari. Into
`docs/decode/README.md` §AV1 (new) and [`README.md`](README.md) §A2.

### 4 WASM

Build dav1d (pinned tag) with emscripten for both bit-depth templates (`-Dbitdepths=8,16`,
`-Denable_asm=false` — its assembly is x86/Arm only), plain and with `-msimd128` (the compiler's
vectorisation; an earlier build had none); one build with
threads off and one with threads on if it builds (record why not if not). A small JS wrapper in the
shape `decoder.js` needs — bytes of one temporal unit in, the planes out, decoder state reused across
a group — under `lab/av1/dav1d-wasm/`. Exact against native dav1d (row 1, or ffmpeg's libdav1d if
row 1 is not done) on lossless streams at 8/10/12 bit and 4:0:0/4:4:4. Report the `.wasm` size raw
and gzipped and the build's flags. Nothing built is committed; the build script is.

### 5 SEAM

An answer, not code. In [`README.md`](README.md) §A1 (or a new `docs/av1/adr-unit.md` if it does
not fit), propose:

* where the codec tag lives (series metadata field name, values, and what a client does with a value
  it does not know);
* how `decoder.js` dispatches by it, keeping the output contract `{pixels, width, bits, signed, range}`;
* **if** a group of G > 1 frames is the unit: how an ask for frame N is served (the group from its
  keyframe? which bytes go first?), how the store indexes a group, how the fill's order and the
  decoder pool change (a group to one decoder), and what the cache holds. Read `WIRE.md`,
  `ARCHITECTURE.md` and `adr-stream-shape.md` first; name every invariant the change breaks.

Mark what the proposal needs from SIZE and SPEED before a G can be chosen.

### 6 SIZE

Lossless bytes per frame and per series on every set from rows 1 and 2: HTJ2K (the project's
profile, `docs/FIXTURES.md`), lossless JPEG XL as a reference column only (libjxl, effort 7 — not
a candidate unless the owner says), AV1 intra, AV1 inter at G = 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 and the whole series, for
each encoder row 1 found exact, at its slowest preset and one practical preset. Record encode time
(an ingest cost, offline). Verdict per content: AV1's ratio against HTJ2K at each G, and the
smallest G that collects most of the gain. Into [`README.md`](README.md) §A1 with the content named.

### 7 DEPTH

For the CT data (12-bit signed) and a 16-bit set: signed → offset (a series whose stored range fits 12 bits
after its offset is coded as 12-bit — check the range per series, never assume it), coded as 12-bit (Professional
profile) — which decoders take it (row 3's list, dav1d); and for > 12 bits, the splits that stay
exact (high and low bytes as two 8-bit 4:0:0 streams; 12 + 4; others you find), their bytes against
HTJ2K's, and what each costs the decoder (two decodes and a merge). Into [`README.md`](README.md) §A3.

### 8 DEC

Behind the proposal of row 5 **for G = 1 only** (a frame decodes alone): the series' codec tag picks
the decoder module in `client/downloader/decoder.js` (or a sibling module it loads); AV1 frames go
through the row 4 build; the output contract is unchanged, so `consumer.js` and everything above do
not change. Add an AV1 set to the conformance suite's downloader arm with exact checksums, a
warm-up frame per shape (`decode/README.md` §Warming the decoders), the notices the shipped build
owes ([`licensing.md`](licensing.md) §What it obliges) served beside it, and keep the gate green. If row
5's proposal says G = 1 needs a wire or store change after all, stop and say so under `## Blocked`.

### 9 SPEED

The fill is decoder-bound, and an earlier desktop measurement put AV1 near 10× HTJ2K's decode time
a frame, so this row may decide the phase. Decode time per frame, interleaved, n ≥ 15, in Node and headless Chromium, unthrottled and at 4×
CPU throttle: OpenJPH on the HTJ2K frames, dav1d-WASM and WebCodecs (where row 3 says exact) on
the AV1 frames of the same content, intra and at the G row 6 recommends. From those and row 6's
bytes, the implied cost of an ask during a fill (bytes and decodes from the keyframe) and the fill's
decode time with today's decoder count. Into `docs/decode/README.md` §AV1 and
[`README.md`](README.md) §A1–A2.
